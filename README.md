# Checkers Board A-Frame Project

This is an A-Frame-based virtual Checkers board project with 3D models, textures, and interactive elements. You can use this project as a starting point for creating your own immersive Checkers game.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the A-Frame scene setup.
- `3dmodels/`: Directory containing 3D model assets used in the project.
  - `3dmodels/scene.gltf`: The 3D model of the king piece.
  - `3dmodels/textures/`: Directory containing texture assets.
    - `3dmodels/textures/blackWhite.png`: Texture for the black and white squares on the board.
    - `3dmodels/textures/whiteMarble.jpg`: Texture for the ground plane.
    - `3dmodels/textures/tilesNormalMap.png`: Normal map for the ground plane.
- `pano.jpg`: Panoramic background image for the sky.

## Features

- A virtual Checkers board with alternating black and white squares.
- A 3D model of a king piece that you can interact with.
- An immersive 360-degree panoramic background.
- A video player that can play a video.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser that supports A-Frame (e.g., Firefox, Chrome).

3. Explore the virtual Checkers board. You can move around using the WASD keys or by clicking and dragging the mouse.

4. Interact with the 3D king piece and the video player as desired.

## Customization

- To customize the textures or 3D models, replace the existing assets in the `3dmodels/textures/` directory and update the `src` attributes in the HTML.

- Modify the A-Frame scene and JavaScript code to add more interactivity or features to your project.
